# CodeSynergy30: Human-AI Pair Programming Challenge

Welcome to my 30-day journey of coding with AI! This project documents my experience pair programming with an AI assistant, exploring various coding concepts and creating small projects each day.

## ðŸš€ Challenge Overview

For 30 days, I'll be working on a new coding project every day, assisted by an AI. Each project will start with a basic implementation and then (hopefully) include a twist or enhancement to make it more challenging and interesting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Explore the potential of human-AI collaboration in coding
- Improve my programming skills across various languages and concepts
- Document the process and insights gained from this unique coding experience
- Find limitations and strengths to get a better hold on what is possible

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Each day's project is contained in its own folder, named `Day_XX_ProjectName`. 

- Source code files
- A README.md explaining the project, the AI's contributions, and my learnings

## ðŸ¤– The AI Assistant

I'm collaborating with an AI assistant for this challenge. Currently (ChatGPT4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5)

- Brainstorming project ideas
- Providing code snippets and explanations
- Debugging and problem-solving
- Offering enhancements and optimizations

## ðŸŒŸ Key Learnings

(This section will be updated throughout the challenge with insights and lessons learned from the challenge)
Day 1: Made a pong game and ran into a few problems namely I was trying to create a telegraphed launch of the ball after each score so the ball didn't suddenly launch from mid screen with no time to react. The implementation only seems to work 50% of the time since the ball only launches towards the top or the bottom of the screen and it didn't seem to be predicting correctly. I couldn't get the AI to fix the logic and I couldn't figure it our either.
